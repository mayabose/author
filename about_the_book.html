    <p>The Seventh Star is the type of jewel that cannot help but attract unwanted attention. More legend than fact, the ancient world-ending diamond has always beckoned to those who are brave, desperate, and greedy. But things have changed since ancient times--war looms on the horizon, and the rulers of the world have never felt more desperate.<br>*<br>Beautiful, arrogant, and without a conscience, Queen Calypso al-Jabri is the most powerful magician in the archipelago. Her only problem is that she is dying of a painful disease that eventually claims the lives of all magic users, and her efforts to hide this one weakness are slowly crumbling. She needs a miracle--and what better miracle exists than the Seventh Star? <br>*<br>Greed is the only language Lilja Sigurv knows. Robbed of the ability to speak or write, she ignores her hunger for a better life and survives as a contortionist thief. Her dangerous line of work carries her into the path of Raphael Gilsson, a corrupt politician who has recently lost everything: his estate, reputation, and fortune--and fully intends on stealing it all back. Together, they devise a crazed diamond heist that promises to solve all of their problems.<br>*<br>However, the Seventh Star is only one mere jewel, and they are not the only ones after this mythical prize. Amid a tangle of ulterior motives and political intrigue, desperation quickly gives way to betrayal--and ultimately murder.
